MAJOR fixes to the determination of calling conventions...

Adjusted some instructions, to match a little bit more closely to IDA Pro's output.
I'm still working out segments and markers in the disassembly output.. (like 'byte ptr', 'dword ptr', 'qword ptr', ...)
Just been busy lately.
I intend to add an entire parser for writing assembly code at a memory location, very soon
