EyeStep utility was removed because I rushed it.
Too many complains about its "coding styles" or whatever.
Check out my new Memory repository.
Hopefully I don't get arsed about using DWORD_PTR now
in a library that is dependant on WINAPI.

MAJOR fixes to the determination of calling conventions...
The psuedo-code output from the Analyze function is not fully tested,
but I have redone the entire method for getting a calling convention
automatically (Based within the function itself, no external XREFS)

Adjusted some instructions, to match a little bit more closely to IDA Pro's output.
I'm still working out segments and markers in the disassembly output.. (like 'byte ptr', 'dword ptr', 'qword ptr', ...)
Just been busy lately.
I intend to add an entire parser for writing assembly code at a memory location, very soon
