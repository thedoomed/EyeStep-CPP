# About

EyeStep is a full, compact x86 disassembler designed
for both internal(DLL) and executable(EXE) applications.

It is original, based on the intel references at:
http://ref.x86asm.net/coder32.html

It features everything except for SIMD instructions
but I intend to add support for that and possibly x64
in the future.
